Things that would be nice to have..

- 
Comments (if anyone ever reads any of this).
      [This](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/static-comments/)
      looks like the way forward.
-  BiBTeX integration.  Check out
      [jekyll-scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar).
      This would mean abandoning the standard GitHub Pages
      build process though.  Not sure I am ready for that.
-   Tags:
    [this](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/)
    looks promising with an implementation
    [here](https://github.com/sergodeeva/sergodeeva.github.io).
    [DONE: it was easier than expected]
-   Excerpts on the home page [DONE]
