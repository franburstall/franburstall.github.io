Like many before me, I wanted to tag posts, display those
tags and have a page for each tag which listed tagged
posts. As usual, step 1 is to ask the internet where I found
two helpful articles:

* <https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/>
* <https://blog.lunarlogic.io/2019/managing-tags-in-jekyll-blog-easily/>

Armed with these, let us accomplish these tasks.

## Tag the posts

Simply list the tags in the frontmatter:
```yaml
---
layout: post
title: Tags for Jekyll posts in 2022
tags: jekyll
---
```
## List the tags

A page's tags are kept in `page.tags` so you can display
them in the `post` layout with something like
{% raw %}
```html
<span>
{% for tag in page.tags %}
{% capture tag_name %}{{ tag }}{% endcapture %}
  <a href="/tag/{{ tag_name }}">
    <code><nobr>#{{ tag_name }}</nobr></code>
  </a>
{% endfor %}
</span>
```
{% endraw %}
Similarly, in the `home` layout, do:
{% raw %}
```html
{% for post in site.posts %}
  <li>
    <span>{{ post.date }}</span>
	<span>
    {% for tag in post.tags %}
    {% capture tag_name %}{{ tag }}{% endcapture %}
      <a href="/tag/{{ tag_name }}">
	    <code><nobr>#{{ tag_name }}</nobr></code>
	  </a>
    {% endfor %}
    </span>
    <h3>
      <a href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}">
        {{ post.title | escape }}
      </a>
    </h3>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}
Note that each tag is wrapped in a link to `/tag/some-tag`.
We make the end-points of these links next.

## Tag pages

The plan is to have a folder `/tag` at top-level containing
files `some-tag.md` for each tag `some-tag`.  Their content
is just:
```yaml
---
layout: tag-page
title: "Tagged with #some-tag"
tag: some-tag
---
```
Make a layout `tag-page.html` thusly:
{% raw %}
```html
---
layout: default
---
<div>
  {{ content }}
  <h1>Posts tagged #{{ page.tag }}</h1>
  <ul>
  {% for post in site.tags[page.tag] %}
    <li>
      <span>{{ post.date }}</span>
      <span>
      {% for tag in post.tags %}
	  {% capture tag_name %}{{ tag }}{% endcapture %}
	    <a href="/tag/{{ tag_name }}">
		  <code><nobr>#{{ tag_name }}</nobr></code>
	    </a>
      {% endfor %}
      </span>
      <h2>
        <a>{{ post.title | escape }}</a>
      </h2>
      <p>{{ post.description }}</p>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
Here we see how things have moved on since 2017 when
[longqian.me](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/)
was writing: then you have to build `site.tags` yourself
with a cunning piece of `liquid`.  Now `jekyll` provides it
for us.

Finally, with
[lunarlogic](https://blog.lunarlogic.io/2019/managing-tags-in-jekyll-blog-easily/),
we want the machine to make the tag pages when a new tag is
used.  She provides a hook that you put in `_plugins` for
this.  At first I though I was out of luck because GitHub
Pages runs Jekyll in safe mode and so won't execute the hook.
But then the penny dropped: I don't *need* this to run on
GitHub.  Each tag file creation is a one-off event that can
be done by Jekyll locally.

So mission accomplished and another piece of the jigsaw is
in place.
