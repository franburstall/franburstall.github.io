You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead
and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You
can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most
common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web
server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is
updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: even
without `liquid`:

``` ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

Here is a little lisp:
``` emacs-lisp
(setq foo 'bar)
```

Some maths: $E=mc^2$.  What about displayed maths?

$$
\int_0^x t\,dt=x^2/2
