I am [Fran
Burstall](https://people.bath.ac.uk/feb/home.html), a mathematician, kite-flyer and sometime emacs hacker.

## Mathematician

I am a sort of differential geometer working at the
[University of Bath](https://www.bath.ac.uk).

Check out my
[papers](https://people.bath.ac.uk/feb/papers.html).

## Kite-flyer

I used to fly at number 2 for [Team
Flame](http://www.teamflame.co.uk/): many times UK champions
and once 5th in the world.

I am currently UK Individual Champion though this may change soon.

## Emacs hacker

I have two (rather niche) projects on MELPA:

* [amsreftex](https://melpa.org/#/amsreftex)
* [ivy-emms](https://melpa.org/#/ivy-emms)

I also have contributed to
[EMMS](https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/) and
[ivy-bibtex](https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex).
